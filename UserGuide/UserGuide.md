# FANGO User Guide

## 1. Introduction 

### What is FANGO?
`FANGO` is a just-in-time language companion designed for travellers, learners, and curious explorers. Instead of studying lessons, you learn from the world around you—by snapping a photo of real-world objects. 

`FANGO` instantly identifies the object, translates it into your chosen language, pronounces it aloud, and gives you practical phrases you can use immediately.

### Who is this guide for?
Anyone using the `FANGO` mobile or web app to translate objects, learn vocabulary on the go, or personalize their language-learning experience.
